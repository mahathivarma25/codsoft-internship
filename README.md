## ðŸŽ¬ TASK 1 - Movie Genre Classification

**Objective:**  
Develop a machine learning model to predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary.

**Description:**  
Using NLP techniques, this project classifies movie plot summaries into appropriate genres. The model leverages text vectorization methods and classifiers to accurately label the genre based on the story context.

**Techniques & Tools:**  
- Text preprocessing (Tokenization, Stopword removal)  
- TF-IDF Vectorization  
- Word Embeddings  
- Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM)

## ðŸ’³ TASK 2 - Credit Card Fraud Detection

**Objective:**  
Build a predictive model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions.

**Description:**  
The project uses anonymized transactional data to identify suspicious or fraudulent activity. Models are trained and evaluated on their ability to distinguish between genuine and fraudulent transactions.

**Techniques & Tools:**  
- Data preprocessing & feature scaling  
- Handling class imbalance with SMOTE  
- Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests  
- Performance metrics: Precision, Recall, F1 Score

## ðŸ“© TASK 3 - Spam SMS Detection

**Objective:**  
Create an AI model to classify SMS messages as spam or legitimate.

**Description:**  
This project focuses on Natural Language Processing to detect unwanted or spam SMS messages. Text messages are transformed into numerical features using vectorization techniques and classified using ML algorithms.

**Techniques & Tools:**  
- Text cleaning and preprocessing  
- TF-IDF Vectorization, Word Embeddings  
- Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines  
- Evaluation via Confusion Matrix & Accuracy
